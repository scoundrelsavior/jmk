<p style="text-align:center;color:#EFEFEF;" class="toptitle"><b>The Murderous Sex Cult<br>of John Mark Karr</b></p>

<p class="Montserrat-ExtraLightItalic">If I am, or have ever been, the leader of a large group of like-minded individuals with a central cause, it would never be modeled after Manson or Jones and it certainly would not be called a cult. If the focus of our group is little girls, I would not be raising them for sex. I would be raising an army.</p>

<p><b>(JMK)</b> 06/07/24 - On November 18th 1978, Jim Jones led 909 members of The People's Temple to commit suicide by drinking a cyanide laced grape flavored drink. Nine others perished that day by the hands of Jones' loyal death squad. Hanging above Jones' pulpit in the pavilion where the deaths took place was a plaque that read, "Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it."</p>

<p>Anthony Katsaris traveled to Jonestown with Congressman Leo Ryan to persuade his sister to return with him to Potter Valley California. Anthony just looks thankful and happy to be standing next to his sister. Maria, on the other hand, has a far away look on her face of utter obstination. Though the source of this photo did not credit him, it was likely taken by San Francisco Examiner photographer, Greg Robinson, who was killed by Jones' death squad at the Port Kaituma airstrip. On April 17th 1978, in a radio transmission from Jonestown to address concerned relatives in America, Maria Katsaris tells her father that he raped her, starting from childhood, and that she will never leave Jonestown and return to the US. Listen to her full statement <a href="mariakatsarisradiocall.mp3" target="_blank">here</a>. Maria Katsaris was one of Jim Jones' closest assistants. She was thought to be one of his lovers. In the middle of the mass suicides, Maria handed off a million dollars in a suitcase, to Tim Carter and his brother Mike Carter, to be delivered to the Russian Embassy in Georgetown. Maria died with Jim Jones and 909 others.</p>

<p>I'm no stranger to leaders and organizers of religious groups in foreign lands. My father was a missionary preacher in Jamaica in the late 50's. My father did some preaching at the church where he attended as a child. He did radio sermons in Atlanta. His first wife was the daughter of a preacher. His second wife, my mother, was also the daughter of a preacher. My mother was a missionary preacher as a teenager in the mid 50's on the U.S. west coast that included the states of California and Oregon. My mother and father were both Pentecostal preachers during their marriage from 1958 to 1969. After they married in 1958, my mother returned to my father's previous missionary work in Jamaica. My mother's father was a church pastor on several occasions in the United States. Her father was a missionary evangelist in Guatemala, Central America in the 1970's.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was investigated by the FBI for planning to organise a sex cult involving teenage girls. A computer, belonging to a person in the state of Louisiana containing the alleged plan, was seized by the FBI but was later returned to its owner with insufficient evidence to charge me with a crime. I was informed from start to finish by a source who knew the Louisiana computer owner. I was never approached by the FBI personally. Read Lei Sussurra's article, <a href="https://leisussurra.uk/#karrcult" target="_blank">Karr Contemplates Creation of Cult</a>.</p>

<p>In 2010, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel, who lived in the Marina District of San Francisco, interviewed with mainstream media for two months (that's months - not days or weeks) wherein she said I was the leader of a sex cult. Her account was filled with stories of the sexual abuse of little girls and a death squad that would kill on my command. The San Francisco Police, along with the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, were part of the investigation. If the FBI was involved in 2010, I wouldn't know about it but would not be surprised.</p>

<p>Fox News reported that there was a criminal warrant out for my arrest. Believing this ‘news’, I flew from Paris to America to face up to these charges. There never was a warrant. The DA's office in San Francisco made an official statement that they never had plans to issue a warrant out for my arrest. Instead, I was served with a restraining order to stay away from Spiegel which was totally ridiculous as I had to fly from Europe to be served with an order to stay away from a person in another continent. I returned to Paris in a week’s time of arriving back in America. My regrets for returning to America at all are numerous. I took risks and I suffered for the week and a half I was there.</p>

<p>Spiegel claimed to be one of my past students though she was in a totally different grade from the one I worked with in San Francisco. She told one lie after another about me from saying that I led a cult of JonBenet Ramsey look alike little girls to saying that I asked her to walk the streets of San Francisco at night seeking little girls to abduct for my sexual pleasure or for the cause of my cult. JonBenet Ramsey look alikes, indeed. I am not nor have I ever been obsessed with any one little girl from my past. The media gave her center stage to dismantle me. Read more in Lei Sussurra's article, <a href="https://leisussurra.uk/#spiegelcollection" target="_blank">Samantha Spiegel's Macabre Collection of Killers</a>.</p>

<p>It was brought to my attention by those who watched the 2010 coverage that I was compared to Charles Manson and to People's Temple leader Jim Jones in the media. Manson ordered his followers to murder several people in Southern California. His cult was referred to as the Manson Family. Spiegel actually corresponded with Manson. Jones led 909 of his followers to suicide on November 18th 1978. The biggest mistake Jim Jones made was allowing the American government to know the location of his group. The most successful group or organisation the likes of The People's Temple or The Immaculates is one of a covert and nomadic existence.</p>

<p>As late as 2017, a reporter asked me if I still led a cult. If I am, or have ever been, the leader of a large group of like-minded individuals with a central cause, it would never be modeled after Manson or Jones and it certainly would not be called a cult. If the focus of our group is little girls, I would not be raising them for sex. I would be raising an army.</p>
