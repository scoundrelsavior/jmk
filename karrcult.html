<p style="text-align:center;color:#EFEFEF;" class="toptitle"><b>The Murderous Sex Cult<br>of John Mark Karr</b></p>

<p class="Montserrat-ExtraLightItalic">In 2007, I was investigated by the FBI for planning to organise a sex cult involving teenage girls. A computer containing the alleged plan was seized by the FBI. In 2010, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel interviewed with mainstream media for two months wherein she said I was the leader of a sex cult. Her account was filled with stories of the sexual abuse of little girls and a death squad that would kill on my command.</p>

<p><b>(JMK)</b> 06/07/24 - On November 18th 1978, Jim Jones led 909 members of The People's Temple to commit suicide by drinking a cyanide laced grape flavored drink. Nine others perished that day by the hands of Jones' loyal death squad. Hanging above Jones' pulpit in the pavilion where the deaths took place was a plaque that read, "Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it."</p>

<p>Anthony Katsaris traveled to Jonestown with Congressman Leo Ryan to persuade his sister, Maria Katsaris, to return with him to Potter Valley California. In the photo, Anthony just looks thankful and happy to be standing next to his sister. His face speaks volumes of his adoration and love for a sister it seems he'd love to hold and never release. Maria, on the other hand, has a far away look on her face of utter obstination. Though the source of this photo did not credit him, it was likely taken by San Francisco Examiner photographer, Greg Robinson, who was killed by Jones' death squad at the Port Kaituma airstrip. Anthony Katsaris was badly wounded on the airstrip alongside Congressman Leo Ryan and others who were killed.</p> 

<p>On April 17th 1978, in a radio transmission from Jonestown to address concerned relatives in America, Maria Katsaris tells her father that he raped her, starting from childhood. She vows she will never leave Jonestown and return to the US. Listen to her full statement <a href="mariakatsarisradiocall.mp3" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 

<p>Maria Katsaris was one of Jim Jones' closest assistants. She held one of the top leadership positions in the organisation. In news articles, she is disrespectfully referred to as one of Jim Jones' mistresses. Some believe Katsaris was the last to die in Jonestown as she was the one who shot Jim Jones before killing herself; however, there is no definite evidence of just who killed Jones. In the middle of the mass suicides, Maria handed off a suitcase filled with half a million dollars to Mike Prokes, Tim Carter and his brother Mike Carter. In a 1978 interview with the Carter brothers, Mike Carter said that authorities reported to the press that there was half a million dollars in the suitcase. In that same interview, Tim Carter said they had no idea how much money was in a suitcase because they weren't informed of the amount and certainly didn't count it. In subsequent interviews, many years later, Tim Carter said the amount was a million and a half dollars. The three men were armed with handguns and were instructed by Katsaris to deliver the cash to the Russian Embassy in Georgetown. In the 1978 interview, Tim Carter and Mike Carter said that the men had transferred the cash into a bag and left it in a chicken house. They both reported that they ran for their lives from Jonestown and were picked up by Guyanese authorities hours later and taken to police headquarters where they were under protective custody for a time but not under arrest. The fate of the cash was never disclosed. Maria Katsaris died on the night of November 18th, 1978 in Jim Jones' cabin by self-administered cyanide poisoning.</p>

<p>I'm no stranger to leaders and organizers of religious groups in foreign lands. My father was a missionary preacher in Jamaica in the late 50's. He did some preaching at the church where he attended as a child. He did radio sermons in Atlanta. His first wife was the daughter of a preacher. His second wife, my mother, was also the daughter of a preacher. My mother's father was a church pastor on several occasions in the United States. Her father was a missionary evangelist in Guatemala, Central America in the 1970's. My mother was a missionary preacher as a teenager in the mid 50's on the U.S. west coast that included the states of California and Oregon. After they married in 1958, my mother returned on several occasions to my father's previous missionary work in Jamaica. My mother and father were both Pentecostal preachers during their marriage from 1958 to 1969. I do admit that, with such a religiously rooted set of parents and grandfather, there was an influence in my life to possibly pursue a similar path.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was investigated by the FBI for planning to organise a sex cult involving teenage girls. A computer, belonging to a person in the state of Louisiana, containing the alleged plan, was seized by the FBI. Supposedly, there was a series of communications between a person alleged to be me and another person about the creation of a sex cult with a theme of moms and their teenage daughters. The FBI held the computer for several days. It was later returned to its owner with insufficient evidence to charge me with a crime. I was informed from start to finish by a source who knew the Louisiana computer owner. I was never approached by the FBI personally. Read Lei Sussurra's article, <a href="https://leisussurra.uk/#karrcult" target="_blank">Karr Contemplates Creation of Cult</a>.</p>

<p>In 2010, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel, who lived in the Marina District of San Francisco, interviewed with mainstream media for two months (that's months - not days or weeks) wherein she said I was the leader of a sex cult. Her account was filled with stories of the sexual abuse of little girls and a death squad that would kill on my command. The San Francisco Police, along with the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, were part of the investigation. If the FBI was involved in 2010, I wouldn't know about it but would not be surprised.</p>

<p>Spiegel claimed to be one of my past students though she was in a totally different grade from the one I worked with in San Francisco. She told one lie after another about me from saying that I led a cult of JonBenet Ramsey look alike little girls to saying that I asked her to walk the streets of San Francisco at night seeking little girls to abduct for my sexual pleasure or for the cause of my cult. JonBenet Ramsey look alikes, indeed. I am not nor have I ever been obsessed with any one little girl from my past. The media gave her center stage to dismantle me. Read more in Lei Sussurra's article, <a href="https://leisussurra.uk/#spiegelcollection" target="_blank">Samantha Spiegel's Macabre Collection of Killers</a>.</p>

<p>Fox News reported that there was a criminal warrant out for my arrest. Believing this ‘news’, I flew from Paris to America to face up to these charges. There never was a warrant. The District Attorney's office in San Francisco, headed at that time by now Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, made an official statement that they never had plans to issue a warrant for my arrest. Instead, I was served with a restraining order to stay away from Spiegel which was totally ridiculous as I had to fly from Europe to be served with an order to stay away from a person in another continent. I returned to Paris in a week’s time of arriving back in America. My regrets for returning to America at all are numerous. I took risks and I suffered for the week and a half I was there.</p>

<p>It was brought to my attention by those who watched the 2010 coverage that I was compared to Charles Manson and Jim Jones in the media. I had already been compared to Manson by his prosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi, in 2006; however, Spiegel brought him back in 2010 because she was corresponding with him at the time. She was also corresponding with Richard Ramirez and Richard Allen Davis. I had a past with Davis through an FBI investigation going back to at least 2001. Read more in my October 2023 article, <a href="pollyklaas">The Disastrous Abduction of Polly Klaas</a>. Spiegel stated in interviews that she had expressed to Davis that she wanted to have his baby. Polly Klaas's father, Marc Klaas, interviewed about Spiegel's comments.</p>

<p>As late as 2017, a reporter asked me if I still led a cult. I responded, "After seven years, you're still asking me that? Unbelievable!" If my answer to the reporter's question had been affirmative, the story according to Spiegel in 2010 would have been a gross misrepresentation of the real thing. Her foolish notion that I would organise a cult with JonBenet Ramsey look alike little girls is a total insult. Her accusation that I sent her out in the middle of the night seeking out little girls for my murderous sex cult is totally stupid. San Francisco, of all places, would never be the site of any such nonsense, especially not in the middle of the night like some drug addict seeks out drugs. A cult that kidnaps its children? That's rich and it's a total lie. Had Spiegel told the story of a Karr cult right, it would have been far more interesting than her nonsensical lies.</p>

<p>Never read this and think that Samantha Spiegel was ever my Maria Katsaris. She was not. No time in her life did Katsaris ever deceive her leader. Spiegel, on the other hand, stabbed me in the back and turned on me like a mad dog. She dragged me through the mire in a media interview campaign that went on for two months. Maria Katsaris was loyal to her leader until the bitter end. She carried out financial missions involving half a million dollars or more on the final day, knowing she would be dead before the day was through. She was likely with Jim Jones when he died. If she shot Jones in the end, it would have been at his request. She would have yet again been carrying out the final wishes of her leader. But loyalty is not goodness, especially in this case. Maria Katsaris had a darkness within. Her leader was evil. As one of his closest, Maria Katsaris was evil as well. I wish she had returned to Potter Valley California with her brother, Anthony. I wish Anthony would have embraced his lovely sister Maria that day in November 1978 and never let her go.</p>

<p>If I am, or have ever been, the leader of a large group of like-minded individuals with a central cause, it would never be modeled after Manson or Jones and it certainly would not be called a cult. My followers would love me. They would not fear me. Moreover, I would love them and would want the best for them all. We would be united in a common cause. Our group would lead a very covert and nomadic existence. And finally, if the focus of our group is little girls, I would not be raising them for sex. I would be raising an army.</p>
