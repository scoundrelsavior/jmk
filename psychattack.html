<p align="center"><strong>Summary Psych Diagnoses of Public Figures and the Unethical Power it Wields in the Media</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2006 and beyond, psychiatrists have issued public diagnoses not only of me but of other public figures without having met them and certainly without any evaluations in a clinical setting conducted directly with the subject to come to their conclusions. Below are excerpts from one such article from <em>The Independent</em> that demonstrates their approach. The Goldwater Rule deems such public diagnoses as unethical.</p>
<p><em>[He**] has 'dangerous mental illness', say psychiatry experts at Yale conference.  Mental health experts say [he**] is 'paranoid and delusional'</em></p>
<p><em>Dr John Gartner, a practising psychotherapist who advised psychiatric residents at Johns Hopkins University Medical School, said: “We have an ethical responsibility to warn the public about [his**] dangerous mental illness.”</em></p>
<p><em>Dr Gartner, who is also a founding member of Duty to Warn, an organisation of several dozen mental health professionals</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Worse than just being a liar or a narcissist, in addition he is paranoid, delusional and grandiose thinking.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Dr Bandy Lee, assistant clinical professor in the Yale Department of Psychiatry, said: &ldquo;As some prominent psychiatrists have noted, [his mental health**] is the elephant in the room. I think the public is really starting to catch on and widely talk about this now.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>James Gilligan, a psychiatrist and professor at New York University, told the conference he had worked some of the “most dangerous people in society”, including murderers and rapists — but that he was convinced by the “dangerousness” of [this person**].</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked with some of the most dangerous people our society produces, directing mental health programmes in prisons,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked with murderers and rapists. I can recognise dangerousness from a mile away. You don&rsquo;t have to be an expert on dangerousness or spend fifty years studying it like I have in order to know how dangerous this man is.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The panel at Yale School of Medicine abided by &lsquo;the Goldwater rule'* (See description below). Eminent psychiatrists were invited to speak about whether there are other ethical rules that override it, as in ordinary practise,&quot; said the spokesperson. &quot;The organiser, Dr Bandy Lee, agrees with the Goldwater rule but is troubled by its recent expansion (as of March 16, 2017) and the silencing of debate. She hopes that the public and politicians will understand that mental health issues are not to be used as a weapon, just as other health issues are not.</em></p>

<p><em>The doctors have said that even if it is in breach of tradition ethical standards of psychiatry, it was necessary to break their silence on the matter because they feared &ldquo;too much is at stake&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p> *The Goldwater Rule: Section 7 in the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Principles of Medical Ethics, which appeared in the first edition of the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Principles of Medical Ethics in 1973 and is still in effect today states as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;On occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general. However, it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">**IMPORTANT! PLEASE SEE THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE THIS COMMENTARY WAS BASED UPON AT: <a href="https://bit.ly/3aEhzBf">https://bit.ly/3aEhzBf</a></p>
<p><em>&quot;After viewing the original article the above excerpts were taken from, one can clearly see that I'm not the only person in the world this has happened to. Maybe one just has to like the person being 'diagnosed' to see the wrong in it.&quot; JMK</em></p>
