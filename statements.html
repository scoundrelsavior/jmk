<p class="headline">Statements Released by<br>John Mark Karr</p>

<p class="Montserrat-ExtraLightItalic">What follows are statements I have released since 2016. When I have anything I consider important to say, I release a statement here. When and if I find out there are lies circulating about me in the media or I have something to say in response to other issues in the media related to me, I release those statements here. My most recent statements are usually posted at the top of my main page.</p>

<div class="headline"><p>This Means War</p></div>
<p class="articlesubheadings">December 29<sup>th</sup> 2024</p>

<p>In the event that I am ever arrested again for the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, I am prepared to defend myself. My legal defense is not a renunciation nor is it an admission of a lie. It is my right to legally defend myself, whether I am guilty or not guilty.</p>

<p>I will fight extradition back to America in any country I might be arrested in by U.S. authorities. Furthermore, I will make efforts to communicate with authorities in the country that I am arrested in, to consider granting me asylum based on legal persecution by U.S. authorities and based on the threat to my life and safety by certain people in the public in the United States.</p>

<p>I will invoke my 5th Amendment U.S. Constitutional right that grants me protection against self-incrimination. I will invoke this right for any and all questions posed to me in any legal procedure, whether an interrogation, a forced deposition, or otherwise. I will be represented by an attorney at all times possible in the presence of law enforcement.</p>

<p>I will not cooperate with any forensic testing that law enforcement might request or demand of me. I will fight any efforts to harvest a DNA sample. I will refer the courts to the sample taken in 2006, by Boulder Deputy District Attorney Tom Bennett, in a small and confined private jet, parked on an airport tarmac, wherein I was handed swabs to conduct the test on myself. The likelihood of contamination in such a confined environment was high but that is not my problem. If I am legally required to submit to any type of forensic testing, demanded by law enforcement, I will fight their demands in court.</p>

<p>If I am charged with any crime related to the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, once in an American court, I will plead 'not guilty' to all charges brought against me. At that point, I will be prepared to fight all charges against me with the best attorneys I can acquire.</p>

<p>I am not the same person you arrested in 2006. I am not the weak, transgender, pedophile, freak, faggot all of you thought I was when you saw me on television in 2006. I am not the meek, soft spoken, repentant, caring and cooperative school teacher I was in 2006 that all of you laughed at while you called me a delusional liar. I am filled with bitterness, boiling with intense anger, and consumed with the desire for vengeance against my enemies.</p>

<p>In 2006, you arrested me and put me through hell only to release me and brand me a delusional liar. You publicly humiliated me. You bullied me because you saw me as weak. Today, I am not only stronger, I am vicious. My hate for you is the most powerful and intense emotion I have left in me.</p>

<p>I do not care about your desire for justice. I will do everything legally possible to end your quest. I do not care about closure for the family of the victim. I care only about defending myself in every way possible. This means war. (December 29<sup>th</sup> 2024) Share Link - <a href="statements#thismeanswar">This Means War</a></p>

<p class="articlesubheadings">December 12<sup>th</sup> 2024</p>

<p>On December 11<sup>th</sup> 2024, I turned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHCob76kigA" target="_blank">60 years old</a> as a free man, safe and sound, thousands of miles from dreaded America. You think you want to come after me? Good luck with that, you fucking bastards. You won't pursue me because you're too goddamned stupid to even try. If you do decide to pursue me, you won't find me because you're too dumb to know how. I'll turn 61 in freedom in some beautiful foreign land and there won't be a goddamned thing that any of you can do about it. Take the justice that you so fervently seek and shove it up your ass. My secrets will go with me to my grave; one of which you decided to do absolutely nothing about in 2006.

<div id="georgiaconnection" class="articleheadings"><p>The Georgia Connection</p></div>
<p class="articlesubheadings">December 6<sup>th</sup> 2024</p>

<p>On October 4th 2023, News Nation's Ashleigh Banfield released a statement on her television broadcast from the father of JonBenet Ramsey. In it, John Ramsey stated he had "pretty strong evidence" that I had stalked his family well before his daughter was murdered.</p>

<p>Recently, I was told that Mr Ramsey revealed at least a portion of that "pretty strong evidence". It was an old news story released after my 2006 arrest. The Ramseys' housekeeper, at their Charlevoix Michigan vacation home, came forward and said she had caught someone rummaging through the Ramseys' vacation home garage, sometime prior to the death of JonBenet Ramsey, who fit the physical description of the man she was seeing all over the news. If anyone in law enforcement had been interested in the housekeeper's eyewitness account in 2006, they would've taken action and they certainly did not.</p>

<p>It must be asked, how would I know the Ramseys had a vacation home in Charlevoix? I was not a local. Looks like Charlevoix is an end without a beginning and a middle. Singling out Charlevoix with no logical order leading up to the stalking event is a mistake. It's missing the critical sequence of events that would lead up to me even knowing the vacation home in Charlevoix existed or that it belonged to the Ramseys who had a little girl I might be interested in stalking. This missing information would be devastating in a trial, if it ever comes to that. No one falls out of the clear blue sky and lands in the Ramseys' Charlevoix Michigan vacation home garage.</p>

<p>In and around 2006, whenever I was asked how I knew or met JonBenet Ramsey, by the authorities or the media, I declined to reveal my connection to her. Knowing her and accessing her would have required an adult liaison. Otherwise, knowing her would have required some situation that her and I were mutually involved in. As an example of a mutual situation, teachers know their students because of a situation that places them all in a classroom. In that case, no adult liaison is needed.</p>

<p>Then there is this accusation of stalking. In that scenario, no adult liaison nor a mutual situation would be required. However, such a strong accusation still requires evidence of how I knew my victim to begin with. I suppose Mr Ramsey feels that the connection to his daughter has been proven in Charlevoix Michigan by his housekeeper; however, it might be noted that Georgia was my state and his daughter's state and a place I frequented and lived in multiple times for all the years I have resided in the United States. Georgia could have led up to Charlevoix for me but not in reverse order.</p>

<p>If I knew JonBenet Ramsey, our initial connection would have taken place in Georgia where her and I were born and where we had both lived. I've lived in and frequented Atlanta for a lifetime. My father and brothers lived there. I had lived in Atlanta for years on end, alone in one of my dad's houses, during the time the Ramseys lived only a few miles from me. My twin daughters were to be born in January 1990 at Northside Hospital in Atlanta which was the same hospital JonBenet Ramsey was born in the same year. Even after the Ramseys moved away from Atlanta to Colorado, Patsy Ramsey frequently returned to Roswell Georgia with her children to visit her parents.</p>

<p>Am I discounting the housekeeper's eyewitness account that she saw me rummaging through the garage in Charlevoix? Not at all. Eyewitness accounts are powerful, but they can also be dismantled in a court of law by a good attorney, which I intend to have if this ever goes to trial. Since the authorities have seemingly never made the Georgia connection, why do I need to worry about the Charlevoix connection? If I knew JonBenet Ramsey, all roads would lead back to Georgia, whether various end destinations were Charlevoix or Boulder. JonBenet Ramsey was returned to Georgia, from whence she came, to rest eternally in its earth's warm embrace.

<div id="catchmeifyoucan" class="articleheadings"><p>Catch Me If You Can?</p></div>
<p class="articlesubheadings">November 28<sup>th</sup> 2024</p>

<p>A possible present day arrest of JMK would look very different from the 2006 arrest in Bangkok. There would be no more admissions of guilt or talk of loving a little girl and wanting closure for her family by a 'soft spoken school teacher' while he cries in a phone call that's being recorded by U.S. federal agents. The present day version of John Mark Karr is bitter, angry and ready to fight. Today's JMK feels no guilt or compassion or love for any victims or their families. You are all my enemies and I am prepared to conquer you in a bloody battle.</p>

<p>Am I worried I'll be arrested again for the Ramsey murder? Hardly. I do worry a bit about other cases in other parts of the country and the world but not about the dumbest criminal case in history. It takes competency on the part of law enforcement for me to be arrested again pertaining to the dumb ole Ramsey case.</p>

<p>I've only been concerned about the FBI making a move against me for all these years. The FBI and the DOJ are soon to be completely upended by the incoming president of America, Donald Trump. His critics say he's doing this to rid himself of his adversaries and protect himself from legal problems. If Trump aids in my own legal protection, I say, "Hail to the Chief!" My only true nemesis, since I was a teenager, has been the dreaded FBI. I say, bring them to their knees, President Trump. If you can do that for me, I salute you, Mr President!</p>

<p>Catch me if you can? You're all too goddamned stupid to even try. In October 2023, the father of JonBenet Ramsey released a formal statement saying that I stalked his family well before his daughter was murdered. You completely ignored that. You did nothing because you're idiots. Thanks to my beloved American president, Mr Donald Trump, the FBI and DOJ will fall by the wayside in a matter of months. I am thousands of miles outside the U.S. Just try to catch me, you fools. If you're even remotely thinking of approaching me, anywhere in the world, you'd better bring a goddamned army. Sieg!

<div id="johnramseyallegation" class="articleheadings"><p>John Ramsey's Damning Allegation</p></div>
<p class="articlesubheadings">March 5<sup>th</sup> 2024</p>

<p>Only recently did I discover that, on October 4th 2023, News Nation's Ashleigh Banfield released a statement on her television broadcast from the father of JonBenet Ramsey. In it, John Ramsey stated he had "pretty strong evidence" that could prove his allegation against me. If that is true, it would be one of the most damning allegations ever brought against me.</p>

<p>Why did I not find out what Ramsey said about me until recently? Contrary to the public's insistence that I am an attention seeking whore who runs around consuming every shred of news about myself, that is simply not true and never has been. I do not read or view any news or social media about myself. I do not Google my name. I do not Google the Colorado girl's name. With that said, I didn't see the News Nation telecast of October 4th, 2023. It took 5 months for just a fraction of the media coverage in October 2023 to trickle down to me through emails and text messages from people in the public who were letting me know what was being said about me.</p>

<p>The most legally damaging statement made about me during the October 2023 media coverage was the final sentence of the statement from John Ramsey released on News Nation. Ramsey said of me, "There is pretty strong evidence that he was stalking our family for a good while prior to JonBenet's murder.”</p>

<p>If John Ramsey can prove that his above accusation is true, it would establish knowledge of the victim well before the fact. It would also establish proximity to the victim well before the fact. Because John Ramsey is the father of the victim, his words are taken more seriously than most. This information, now public, has certainly compromised any possible ongoing investigations against me.</p>

<p>Regardless of such a serious allegation against me concerning the death of his daughter, I still stand behind what I said of him, his wife, and his son in my October 5th, 2023 public statement. However, I must confirm that I was not aware of Ramsey's strong allegation against me just one day before I released my October 5th 2023 statement wherein I devoted a paragraph to him and his family.</p>

<p>Finally, had I known Mr Ramsey made such an allegation against me five months ago, I certainly would have promptly responded exactly as I have today. I will continue my stance to never read any news articles, watch any news videos, or delve into anything said about me on social media or online forums. I do admit, however, that it cripples me in knowing what is said against me so that I might defend myself. But do I really have a defense against damning allegations against me? I think not. This tiny site is seen by a handful of people. The News Nation telecast, along with other international publications that carried this story, were seen by millions. The few people who do visit this site have no regard for anything I might say in my own defense. (March 5th 2024) Read my October 5th, 2023 statement below.</p>

<div id="protectingkiller" class="articleheadings"><p>I Know Who JonBenet Ramsey's Killer Was<br>And I'm Protecting Them? Think Again!</p></div>
<p class="articlesubheadings">October 5<sup>th</sup> 2023</p>

<p>A reporter from <a href="https://the-sun.com" >The U.S. Sun</a> alerted me via e-mail that there was a reporter who had done an interview with News Nation on October 4th, 2023. In it, the reporter stated that I had told him that I knew who killed JonBenet Ramsey and I was protecting them. I have never said anything like that. If you see me on camera, live, making a complete statement, that's not a soundbite, or taken out of context - you can take that seriously. Otherwise, always doubt anything you read or see about me. It is the media's backstabbing technique reserved especially for me as a pure act of sabotage. Do you want truth or some news media hyped concoction?</p>

<p>And who is this person who killed JonBenet Ramsey that all of you in the public and the media insist that I know and now protect? Her brother? Her father? Her loving mother? I know you would love to see but one of them burn for this child's death. I know it because you have expressed it for decades. I have never suggested that anyone in this family was the killer of this little girl. Has this discussion ever come up with those I have spoken to over the years? Of course. The reason being, these three people have been targets for all these years as suspects in their own family member's death. This is not "the moment you've all been waiting for" when I raise my finger of blame and condemnation and point it at any of the members of JonBenet's family.</p>

<p>In 2006, I took full responsibility for the death of JonBenet Ramsey. In an intense phone call with a professor in Boulder Colorado, I described how I killed JonBenet Ramsey, by my own hand. These descriptions corroborated with physical evidence that was withheld from the public by the coroner and law enforcement for ten years. According to the authorities who arrested me, as well as the FBI - it was information only the killer would know. This is why I, and no one else, was arrested for the murder, kidnapping, and sex assault of JonBenet Ramsey. (October 5, 2023 - Updated 12/04/23 to add that an e-mail from a reporter with The U.S. Sun was the source for my reaction. Updated 03/05/24 to clarify a previous misconception of the information that was presented to me.)</p>

<p>On Tuesday 21 February, a contact sent a text message to me containing this news story from KFM 94.5's website entitled, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231009125436/https://kfm.co.za/articles/2023/02/21/is-she-madeleine-mccann-polish-woman-may-be-missing-toddler-from-15-years-ago" target="_blank">"Is She Madeleine McCann? Polish Woman May Be Missing Toddler From 15 Years Ago."</a> In it, a 21 year old woman named Julia Wendelet is showcased using information from her Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iammadeleinemccan/" target="_blank">@iammadeleinemccan</a> (note how she misspells 'mccann'). You can be rest assured that Julia Wendelet is not the former Madeleine McCann. Madeleine has never been aware of her connection to the media coverage of the Madeleine McCann case. Has she ever seen it in her lifetime? Possibly, but she has never made any personal connection to the news stories over the years. Those involved in taking her were highly skilled, experienced, and well connected. With that said, consider that Madeleine was very well placed. And if she was very well placed, she was then and will be safe, well cared for, and loved.

<p><b>UPDATE!</b> Julia Faustyna aka Julia Wendelet has been claiming for weeks on Instagram and TikTok that she may be Madeleine McCann. Results of a DNA test show that she is 100% Polish. Madeleine is alive but she'll never be found in a sea of dead ends. (April 5, 2023)</p>

<div class="articleheadings"><p>Death Threat E-mail</p></div>
<p class="articlesubheadings">February 1<sup>st</sup> 2023</p>

<p>On January 31st GMT, I received a death threat via e-mail from societysucks88@icloud.com with the subject field: "I want to cut your head off and stuff it up your p**ssy". The e-mail was submitted to the FBI. According to digital forensics, this death threat e-mail was sent from the vicinity of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. The full name of the sender was included in the e-mail sender field and is listed in my Tweet below. A couple of days after my report, the FBI called my US phone number and left a message stating that they were interested in further details. I returned the FBI's call on the following day. I got an e-mail contact from the agent during the call that enabled me to send further information that might lead to the sender of the e-mail. I take death threats seriously. I will report all threats to the FBI, your local authorities, or both. Full email <a href="images/deaththreat-jan31-2023.png" target="_blank">here</a>.

<div class="articleheadings"><p>My Exit From America in 2020</p></div>
<p class="articlesubheadings">January 13<sup>th</sup> 2021</p>
	
<p>In early summer 2020, I sold my house in America and left the United States. It was never any secret that my house was on the market for sale last year. At one point, it was listed on the MLS. I owned the house for only two years and ten months. In 2017, after living for only weeks in the house, I was exposed to the media by people I had allowed in my home as guests. I was portrayed by the media and treated by the public as a dangerous threat to society though I had never been convicted of a crime.</p>

<p>After the 2017 media exposure, some asked me why I returned to America in the first place. I returned to the US in 2017 because I had every right to do so. I returned to the US in 2017 and bought a house there because I had every right to live in my own home, in my own country, as a citizen of the United States with full blown constitutional rights that is afforded to every natural born citizen who has never been convicted of a crime.</p>

<p>I had those rights but, while there, that did not prevent some Americans from violating them wholesale - walking by my house shouting "Murderer!", "Killer!", "Serial Killer" and "Child Rapist" mostly occurring in broad daylight as I worked to restore my historical home which remains an asset to the community long after I am gone.</p>

<p>I also had the right to sell my house and leave the United States in peace and in privacy without the media exploiting the event and without the accusation that I was running from something. I guarded the sale of my home when it occurred last year not because I was sneaking around like some lowly criminal but because of my concerns that the media would exploit the sale of the house as they had exploited the purchase of it which would have compromised not only my privacy but the privacy of the new owner of the home.</p>

<p>After discovering recently that certain persons planned on profiting from and exploiting the release of this information, I reluctantly decided to post this statement on my website almost seven months after the fact. I was never then nor am I now in any way obligated to inform you: my haters, my enemies, and to whom it may concern - but here it is nonetheless. (January 13th 2021)</p>

<div class="articleheadings"><p>My Brush With Kamala Harris</p></div>
<p class="articlesubheadings">November 7<sup>th</sup> 2020</p>
	
<p>In 2010, I was accused of everything from felony death threats to being a sex cult leader. Fox News reported that there was a warrant out for my arrest and that the police in San Francisco were looking for me. The media directed their attention to the San Francisco District Attorney's Office that released this statement in response: "At this point, there is no case to review for charging," says spokeswoman Erica Derryck." (Seattle Weekly). The San Francisco district attorney at that time was U.S. Vice President elect Kamala Harris who was not swayed by media pressure, false accusations, or public opinion and expeditiously closed down the rumor that her office had criminally charged me.

<p>I have been approached for answers about the latest development in the case surrounding Madeleine McCann. The authorities are determined that any pedophile they can prove mere proximity to Madeleine is a prime suspect in this case and worse - a killer of a little girl. This time around, it is imprisoned pedophile, Christian Brückner. He has vowed that he will admit to nothing until authorities can provide proof that he is somehow connected to Madeleine McCann. In other words, he's said a sound "f**k you" to the law who wants to peg him. The truth is, they will not be able to show such proof. He's never met Madeleine because her disappearance had nothing to do with a pedophile imprisoned in Germany or anywhere else in the world. He would, however, make a wonderful fall guy who authorities would not hesitate to elect. Do you want the truth or a poor excuse for it provided to you by out of touch authorities trying to make a name for themselves? Madeleine McCann is alive and well and unaware of the swirl that surrounds her.

<div id="dnaprobe" class="articleheadings">The 2016 DNA Probe</p></div>
<p class="articlesubheadings">December 15<sup>th</sup> 2016</p>

<p>Boulder Police is asking the state to conduct a new round of DNA testing. It's pretty obvious why they should make such a request now. Last month, DNA experts uncovered that the DNA that let me walk in 2006 was a composite of several DNA samples in one. It was also uncovered that Lacy was fully aware that the tiny sample was a composite before she used it to "exonerate" the Ramsey's. The "little DNA that could" is slowly capitulating. A call to the state for a nice replacement has become a necessity for those who insist that this is a DNA case while experts for years have said it is not.</p>
	
<p>Lacy publicly humiliated me in front of the whole world with her accusation that I was a delusional liar because my DNA didn't match that random, drive-by DNA that established nothing and could never be used to pinpoint any one person, much less a killer. I must admit, I'm sad to see that little DNA sample go. It's been good to me over the years.</p>
	
<p>I've been asked if I'm worried about this latest DNA development. Of course, I've always had great concerns that my DNA was left behind; however, with the small time local authorities who are in charge of this case along with the corruption that has been proven over the years, I'm not as worried as I would be if it were a valid agency with proper resources, not influenced by wealth or fame or political gain. The day this case falls into the hands of the FBI will be the day I'll have something to worry about. (UPDATE: It was confirmed to me in 2018 by a close contact interviewed by the FBI in 2006, along with a media interview with the FBI in September 2023, that the FBI has investigated me for the murder of JonBenet Ramsey all this time.)

<div class="articleheadings">Discovery ID Ramsey Television Special</p></div>
<p class="articlesubheadings">September 16<sup>th</sup> 2016</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:auto;">The American public deserves to know that I gave six hours of quality interview time to Discovery in Bangkok on JonBenet's birthday. I revealed new information about JonBenet's death. You will never hear that. I dismantled the DNA. You will never hear that. I talked about how my DNA was taken in 2006 which was a total joke. You will never hear that. I responded to the ridiculous way Mary Lacy mishandled my arrest in 2006. My right to defend myself and tell my side of the story was dumped. Most importantly, I talked about a law that would save children's lives. This was also axed. I feel the American people have the right to know that they were robbed of all this and more by Discovery's decision to merely roll old 2006 footage and call me a lunatic liar. Six hours were reduced to a few sentences spread across three nights. Investigation Discovery used my image and name to promote their show for three nights making promises that, on the third night, there would be an exclusive interview with me. That never happened. Instead, Americans got the dog and pony show. I am receiving hundreds of visits from Americans looking for an answer. You didn't get those answers in the ID exploitation and public humiliation of John Mark Karr. (September 16th 2016)</p>
