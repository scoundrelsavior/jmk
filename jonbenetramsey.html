<p class="headline">Arrested for the Murder of<br>JonBenet Ramsey</p>

<p class="Montserrat-ExtraLightItalic">Being arrested in 2006 was what I had successfully avoided for 10 years since her death and for the 5 years of international running as a fugitive leading up to my 2006 arrest. The proof of that was the fact that I was in my 5th year of evading California authorities and the FBI when I was arrested against my will in 2006. I did not want fame for killing a child. The media arrived from all over the world and descended in on me against my will. Am I to be blamed for this?</p>

<p><b>(JMK)</b> 06/10/24 - In 2006, I was arrested for the murder, kidnapping, and sex assault of six year old JonBenet Ramsey and extradited from Bangkok to Boulder Colorado. My arrest was based on my account of the night of her death that corroborated with physical evidence withheld from the public by the coroner and law enforcement from 1996 to 2006.</p>

<p>I was released based solely on the fact that my DNA did not match DNA found on her clothing yet not on her body. Though I was ultimately discounted as a lying, lunatic, attention seeking whore, these were not the reasons I was released. It all boiled down to a DNA test. How could a person who had been in hiding for five years and using a pseudonym with his informants manage to cash in on this fame? After all, I did not turn myself in. I didn’t phone CNN. I didn’t turn myself in when I was last in Boulder in 2000. I didn’t cash in on all that supposed fame for ten damned years but I was an attention seeking whore? If I became notorious, it was thrust upon me against my will by the media who showed up like a pack of hungry wolves. So I am to blame for something I didn’t do? Wouldn’t be the first time.</p>

<p>The prosecution finally said she didn’t bring me back on charges at all though strangely, I attended an extradition hearing in a packed, media covered Los Angeles California courtroom where a judge read off all five of the charges in Colorado and asked if I wanted to waive to extradition on those five charges. He read the charges individually. They included such terms as murder in the first degree, kidnapping, and sex assault. I assure you, Ms. Lacy, the charges were real. </p>
	
<p>I was last questioned by private detectives regarding the Ramsey case in 2009 with light contact from private detectives in 2014 but with no questions about the Ramsey case. In 2016, I was lightly questioned by a past agent of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation about this case.</p>

<p>While I'm on the topic of my 2006 arrest for the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, I want to get a few things straight about multiple myths and outright lies that have been told about me over the years. Keep in mind that this section was added to my website in January 2023.</p>

<p>My arrest was not based on a mere confession. My arrest was based on very detailed information that I provided. Furthermore, I was led to believe that all correspondences and phone calls were in strictest confidence by the only person I was talking to: Michael Tracey. The information I provided corroborated with evidence withheld by the coroner and law enforcement for ten years in this case. The investigation lasted for several months prior to my arrest. On my extradition flight from Long Beach, California to Boulder, then assistant district attorney Tom Bennett, who accompanied me on the flight, informed me that, over a ten year period since her death, they had received over 250 false confessions. He said he did not consider my in depth descriptions of the final hours of her life leading up to her death to be false. He continued by saying, "You are very valuable to us, Mr Karr."</p>

<p>I did not provide detailed information about the final hours of JonBenet Ramsey's life because I was a delusional person. I had no mental health history prior to 2006 or since. I have never been diagnosed with any mental illness. Yes, it is true that my mother suffered from mental issues but how dare all of you to blame me for her issues and accuse me of certainly inheriting it. That is totally unfair to me as a person who has always been known as mentally sound, with the exception of the mockery of my mental state as it related to my 2006 arrest.</p>

<p>I did not describe the final hours of the life of JonBenet Ramsey in depth to Michael Tracey because I wanted to be famous. What an appalling and ridiculous assertion that is. The facts that surround my arrest disprove this completely. I used the pseudonym, Daxis, on every correspondence and in every call with the only person I shared with: Michael Tracey. I made every effort not to be caught or have my identity exposed. How does one become famous if they are anonymous? Does a person seeking fame leave their home country; become a fugitive for 5 years; and make absolutely no contact with past friends or family for the 5 years that led up to my 2006 arrest? That would be a person trying to hide - not a person trying to be exposed and famous. Furthermore, if I wanted fame for killing a child, which is nothing less than suicide and is utterly stupid, why didn't I do this ten years prior? I did not because that concept is totally ridiculous and outrageous. Instead, I lived for five of the ten years as a fugitive in foreign countries outside of the US. Also keep in mind that I communicated with Michael Tracey for 4 years by anonymous e-mail. In those 4 years, I never brought up her death or spoke to him in phone calls until the end of that 4 year span of time. This was confirmed by Tracey himself in media interviews. In other words, I wasn't anxious to confess murder to Michael Tracey in that 4 year span of time and waited until the end of that 4 years to finally share with him about the night of JonBenet Ramsey's death.</p>

<p>I did not confess to murdering a child to get a free flight back to America. How totally ridiculous. I had substantial savings readily available to me had I wanted to return to America; however, I did not. Why would I? America was the country I had been running away from for 5 years. Every American who becomes stranded abroad can walk into a US embassy; surrender their passport for a temporary one; and receive a one way ticket back to America. Once they arrive in America, the citizen is required to pay back the price of the ticket to the US embassy to receive their original permanent passport back. They will not receive a further temporary passport until the debt is paid. With all that said, what fool would confess to murdering a child for a free ticket back to a country they had been a fugitive from for five years prior?</p>

<p>I did not turn myself in in 2006. I have never turned myself in in my entire life. There were multiple police at the funeral of Patsy Ramsey anticipating the arrival of someone named Daxis. This was according to Mark Spray who divulged the reason for the large police presence at her funeral. I had no plans to take the chance to return to America for her funeral because it was too risky for me. I did not want to be arrested after successfully being a fugitive for five years.</p>

<p>I did not confess to the murder of JonBenet Ramsey on camera in Thailand. On the next day AFTER my arrest in Thailand, I was taken before the press for a second time by authorities. I was asked several times if I had killed JonBenet Ramsey by members of the press. I finally and very reluctantly replied, "I was with JonBenet when she died. Her death was accidental." That was not a confession to murder. My brother and father were with my grandmother when she died. That doesn't mean they killed her.</p>

<p>I was not released because it was determined I was a delusional, lying, attention seeking whore. I was released on the mere fact that my DNA did not match DNA that law enforcement insisted belonged to the killer. Keep in mind that no DNA was found on her body that belonged to a stranger. The sample they have was found solely on her clothing that has been stored in an evidence room and has been handled over the years by several investigators. DNA experts commented on Fox News that no suspect should be released based solely on their DNA not matching the DNA the authorities held in this case. They referred to that DNA as a "red herring".</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">In summary, being arrested in 2006 was what I had successfully avoided for 10 years since her death and for the 5 years of international running as a fugitive leading up to my 2006 arrest. The proof of that was the fact that I was in my 5th year of evading California authorities and the FBI when I was arrested against my will in 2006. I did not want fame for killing a child. The media arrived from all over the world and descended in on me against my will. Am I to be blamed for this? I made every effort to avoid any detection of my true identity when I had talks with Michael Tracey on encrypted e-mails that hid my IP and in phone calls using SIM chips that did not require a passport ID at the time. All that I did in 2006 was talk to a person in what he guaranteed to me were confidential correspondences. I knew quite a few things that no one should have known had they not been in close proximity to JonBenet Ramsey on the night of her death, including the details of how she died. I shared those things in what I thought was in strictest confidence with Michael Tracey who broke that confidence and turned all of it over to law enforcement which resulted in my unwanted 2006 arrest - an arrest that destroyed five years of remaining free as a successful fugitive. Everything I had built up in that five years was lost completely when I was arrested in 2006. I did not want to be arrested for the murder of JonBenet Ramsey or for any other crime. I wanted to be free to live my life and continue my teaching career outside of America, which is exactly what I did for the five years prior to my 2006 arrest. Just prior to my 2006 arrest, I had just started a new job as a second grade teacher in a posh private school in Bangkok. I had just spent two weeks decorating my classroom which was beautiful with a glass wall on one side that viewed out onto palm trees. I was happy with my life. I was content. I had it all and lost it when my very unwanted arrest occurred.</p>
