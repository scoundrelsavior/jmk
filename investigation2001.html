<div class="headline"><p><b>FBI Investigation for the Serial Murder of Little Girls Across America</b></p></div>

<p class="Montserrat-ExtraLightItalic">In 2000, I moved with my wife and three sons to California. I worked in a prestigious school for girls in San Francisco and ultimately was working on my Masters of Elementary of Education degree, doing a teaching internship at a school in beautiful Napa Valley California. Every morning, I drove my classic Jaguar through famous vineyards to get to my little elementary school in paradise. One day, in the middle of a lesson with my fourth grade classroom, the principal came for me. Waiting in the office of the school were two Napa Valley detectives. My life would never be the same again. I would lose my wife and kids, my career, and my country in a matter of six months.</p>

<p><b>(JMK)</b> 06/11/24 - In Sonoma County, I was investigated for the murder of a twelve year old Santa Rosa girl named Georgia Moses. She was said to have had an intense sense of humor much like another twelve year old girl in the area, Polly Klaas. She was from Georgia. Oddly enough, as a young man working for my father, I rented an apartment in Atlanta to a large African American family by the last name Moses.</p>

<p>The girl’s remains were found a fifteen minute walk from my Petaluma home, wrapped in a piece of carpet and left on the shoulder of Highway 101. Of course, I lived in Petaluma years after her body was discovered; however, it was thought by authorities that I had returned to the scene of my own crime for nostalgic and sentimental reasons.</p>

<p>In 2019, a contact informed me that they were interviewed by the FBI for seven hours in 2006. They stated the interview was as much about Polly Klaas as JonBenet Ramsey. The FBI played numerous recorded calls from 2001 wherein I discussed Klaas in depth with an informant. The FBI stated that I had discussed details of Klaas with her killer in multiple conversations. I have a message for the FBI and Polly Klaas's killer in this October 2023 article. (Photo Designed by John Mark Karr) <a href="pollyklaas" target="_blank">TAP TO VISIT THIS PAGE</a></p>

<p>I was ultimately arrested for alleged possession of child pornography. It might be interesting to note that the prosecution’s hired photographic, age analysis experts could not determine that persons in the five images were under their upper teens in age. If you’re conjuring up images of little six year old girls naked, think again. The images were shown to me by my attorney. They were so blurry, one was hard pressed to assume they were human. One of my attorneys said of one of the images, “is that a close up of a Bartlett pear?”</p>

<p>While locked up in semi-solitary confinement for six months with my only chance of release, a $100,000 bail, I was investigated by the FBI for the murders of unnamed little girls particularly in the states of California, Alabama and Georgia, according to Sonoma County prosecution and police records. At every court hearing for the six months I was in jail, the prosecution consistently brought up the status of the FBI’s investigation, saying to the judge that they were in constant contact with the FBI.</p>

<p>At the end of a grueling six months confinement, the prosecution stated to the judge that they had spoken to the FBI who informed them that their investigation of Karr was over. The prosecution then stated in the same court hearing that, at that point, they had no further interest in holding me incarcerated and accepted the terms of releasing me on my own recognizances.</p>

<p>After my release, I attended two court hearings. My defense presented to the judge that the computer in question was obtained without a search warrant further stating that, though there was a warrant for one of my California homes, there was not a search warrant of the other of my homes where the computer against me was retrieved. The judge instantly said that he thought law enforcement, in his words, ‘jumped the gun’ on retrieving this computer and should have gotten a legal search warrant. The case was almost dismissed until the prosecution spoke up that they needed a chance to tell the judge the intensity of the case - that this was much more serious and involved than just porn charges. The judge said ‘very well’ and the next hearing was scheduled a few weeks later. At the next hearing, the judge said that he had heard what the prosecution had to say and had decided that he would allow the evidence even though it had been found without a search warrant.</p>

<p>I was completely disillusioned with the legal system in Sonoma County. My constitutional rights were completely violated. I felt I would never get a fair trial in a place where evidence found without a search warrant was permitted. That, coupled with the fact that I was on the radar of the FBI for the first time in my life, prompted me to leave America once and for all.</p> 

<p>On a rainy November night in 2001, I boarded a plane in San Francisco bound for London. I would remain out of America for five years until my 2006 arrest. My family thought me to be dead.</p>
 
<p>After my release from the Ramsey case charges in 2006, I was extradited from Colorado to California on 2001 charges of alleged possession of child pornography. During the hearings, the prosecution said that there was a tape drive supposedly found in a box near my evidence therefore it had to be mine. Such logic reminded me of 2001 when a judge said search warrants were unimportant. The prosecution said there were 16,000 images of child porn on that tape drive. Of course this drive did not belong to me but my lawyers and I played along.</p> 

<img src="images/jmksonomalawyers.jpg" alt="JMK Lawyers" id="jmksonomalawyers"/>

<p>My lawyer came to me and said, “The prosecution showed me hundreds of the 16,000 porn images. Guess what the images are of? Little boys. All of them are little boys.” And I thought John Mark Karr was supposed to be a sick pedo attracted to little girls? This matter kind of fizzled out. I think the prosecution knew they were in above their heads trying to first prove the drive belonged to me and secondly prove that I would have interest in child pornography of little boys.</p> 
 
<p>Much to my amazement, one day my lawyers came to me and said the media had leaked to them that the computers held in evidence against me had been lost by the sheriff’s department in a move from an old evidence room to a new one. It seems that there were thousands of pieces of evidence moved but mine was the only evidence lost. I was released from all charges based on lack of evidence.</p>

<p>In reality, the sheriff’s department lost evidence that was found on a hard drive discovered without a search warrant; consisted of five deleted images; was located on a broken hard drive never operated in the state of California; and contained images that the prosecution’s experts could not determine was child pornography.</p>
 
<p>My lawyers were disappointed that the case did not go to trial so they could bury this bogus case against me once and for all. My lawyers did not consider the dropped charges as a victory.</p>

<div class="whatsoevercaption">Being arrested in 2006 was what I had successfully avoided for 10 years since her death and for the 5 years of international running as a fugitive leading up to my 2006 arrest. The proof of that was the fact that I was in my 5th year of evading California authorities and the FBI when I was arrested against my will in 2006. I did not want fame for killing a child. The media arrived from all over the world and descended in on me against my will. Am I to be blamed for this?

<div class="whatsoevercaption"><b style="color:red;">NEW ARTICLE</b>: In 2007, I was investigated by the FBI for planning to organise a sex cult involving teenage girls. A computer containing the alleged plan was seized by the FBI. In 2010, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel interviewed with mainstream media for two months wherein she said I was the leader of a sex cult. Her account was filled with stories of the sexual abuse of little girls and a death squad that would kill on my command.
