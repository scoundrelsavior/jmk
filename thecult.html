<p class="articleheadings">A Sex Cult Protected by a Death Squad</p>

<p class="Montserrat-ThinItalic">In 2007, I was investigated by the FBI for planning to organise a sex cult involving teenage girls. A computer containing the alleged plan was seized by the FBI. In 2010, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel interviewed with mainstream media for two months stating that I was the leader of a sex cult. Her account was filled with stories of the sexual abuse of little girls and a death squad that would kill on my command.</p>

<p><b>(JMK)</b> 07/06/24 - The word 'cult' is the most offensive term that any religious group could ever be called. The word conjures up an image of a flock of fanatics led by a madman who are all hell bent on a cause that leads to self-destruction, the destruction of those who come against the group, or both. This article describes two cult investigations against me. The first investigation was for the plan to create a cult, launched against me in 2007. The second investigation was for leading an already created cult, launched against me in 2010. The 2007 FBI investigation was never truly known to the public. The 2010 investigation was exposed in mainstream media for two months.</p>

<p>I am from a long line of leaders and organisers of religious groups in foreign lands. My father was a missionary preacher in Jamaica in the late 1950's. He also did some preaching at the church he attended as a child. He did radio sermons in Atlanta. His first wife was the daughter of a preacher. His second wife, my mother, was also the daughter of a preacher. My mother's father was a church pastor on several occasions in the United States. Her father was a missionary evangelist in Guatemala, Central America in the 1970's. My mother was a missionary, with a young preacher, as a teenager in the mid 1950's. They spread the gospel on the U.S. west coast that included the states of California and Oregon. After my parents married in 1958, my mother returned, on several occasions, to my father's previous missionary work in Jamaica. My mother and father were both Pentecostal preachers during their marriage from 1958 to 1969. I do admit that, with such a religiously rooted father, mother, and grandfather, there was an influence in my life to possibly pursue a similar path. Many have thought I've done just that.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was investigated by the FBI for planning to organise a sex cult involving teenage girls. A computer containing the alleged plan, belonging to a person in the state of Louisiana, was seized by the FBI. Supposedly, there were a series of communications between a person alleged to be me and another person, discussing the creation of a sex cult with a central focus on moms and their teenage daughters. The FBI held the computer for several days. It was later returned to its owner with insufficient evidence to charge me with a crime. I was informed about the FBI investigation from start to finish by a source who knew the Louisiana computer owner. I was never approached by the FBI personally.</p>

<p>In 2010, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel, who lived in the Marina District of San Francisco, interviewed with mainstream media for two months, saying that I was the leader of a sex cult called <i>The Immaculates</i>. Her account was filled with stories of the sexual abuse of little girls and a death squad that would kill on my command. Spiegel stated that she feared for her own life. Maybe she thought my death squad was coming for her. The San Francisco Police, along with the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, were part of the investigation. If the FBI was involved in 2010, I wouldn't know about it but would not be surprised if they were.</p>

<p>Spiegel claimed to be one of my past students though she was in a totally different grade from the one I worked with in a San Francisco school for girls. She said I led a cult of JonBenet Ramsey look alike little girls. She said that I asked her to walk the streets of San Francisco at night seeking little girls to abduct for my sexual pleasure or for the cause of my cult. JonBenet Ramsey look alikes, indeed. I am not, nor have I ever been, obsessed with any one little girl from my past. The media gave her center stage to expose me.</p>

<p>Fox News reported that there was a criminal warrant out for my arrest. Believing this "news", I flew from Paris to America to face up to these charges. Fox News retracted their statement after I arrived in America. Quite simply, there never was a warrant for my arrest. The District Attorney's office in San Francisco, headed at that time by once Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, made an official statement that they never had plans to issue a warrant for my arrest. Instead, I was served with a restraining order to stay away from Spiegel which was totally ridiculous as I had to fly from Europe to be served with an order to stay away from a person in a continent I had left years prior. I returned to Paris one week and a half after arriving back in America. My regrets for returning to America at all were numerous.</p>

<p>As late as 2017, a reporter asked me if I still led a cult. I responded, "After seven years, you're still asking me that? Unbelievable!" If my answer to the reporter's question had been affirmative, the story according to Spiegel in 2010 would have been a gross misrepresentation of the real thing. Her foolish notion that I would organise a cult with JonBenet Ramsey look alike little girls was a total insult. Her accusation that I sent her out in the middle of the night, seeking out little girls for my murderous sex cult, is totally stupid. San Francisco, of all places, would never be the site of any such nonsense, especially not in the middle of the night like some drug addict seeks out drugs. A cult that kidnaps its children? That's rich and it's a total lie. The real story about my group would have been far more interesting than her nonsensical lies.</p>
