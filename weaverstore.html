<p align="center"><b>Weaver Hardware 1973</b></p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Weaver Hardware was founded by Clarence Weaver. It was located in Hamilton, Alabama on Military Street across the street from the city courthouse. Clarence was married to Gwen Hamilton. They had three children - Bill, Tom, and Jane. Clarence kept it in the family when it came to his store. One of his employees was his brother-in-law, James Carter who was married to his sister Lena Mae. One of the most memorable people in the store was their greeter for many years, their son Tom, who always had a smile and a hardy hello. When I was a small boy, Tom would always hand me a lemon lollipop on every visit. The store had two entrances - one through the front door and one on the side or back as we always called it. They were especially proud of a line of house paint they sold called True Exterior which was featured in some of their ads. They sold a full line of hunting apparel as well as ammunition for all your hunting needs. In later years, Clarence handed the store down to his son, Bill. My grandparents, Mary Etta and Andrew Karr rented a house in Hamilton from them for many years. They referred to the house as the Clarence Weaver place but most of the time just called it the Clarence place. He must have been a good landlord because they were very happy in that house which is no longer there.</p>
