<p class="Montserrat-ExtraLightItalic">On December 11<sup>th</sup> 2024, I turned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHCob76kigA" target="_blank">60 years old</a> as a free man, safe and sound, thousands of miles from dreaded America. You think you want to come after me? Good luck with that, you fucking bastards. You won't pursue me because you're too goddamned stupid to even try. If you do decide to pursue me, you won't find me because you're too dumb to know how. I'll turn 61 in freedom in some beautiful foreign land and there won't be a goddamned thing that any of you can do about it. Take the justice that you so fervently seek and shove it up your ass. My secrets will go with me to my grave - the same secrets you decided to do absolutely nothing about in 2006. <a href="statements#jmkturnssixty" target="_parent">John Mark Karr Turns 60</a> (December 12<sup>th</sup> 2024)</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><p><b>Catch Me If You Can?</p></b></div>
<p style="font-size:0.95rem;text-align:center;margin-top:-15px;">Statement of November 28<sup>th</sup> 2024</p>

<p>A possible present day arrest of JMK would look very different from the 2006 arrest in Bangkok. There would be no more admissions of guilt or talk of loving a little girl and wanting closure for her family by a 'soft spoken school teacher' while he cries in a phone call that's being recorded by U.S. federal agents. The present day version of John Mark Karr is bitter, angry and ready to fight. Today's JMK feels no guilt or compassion or love for any victims or their families. You are all my enemies and I am prepared to conquer you in a bloody battle.</p>

<p>Am I worried I'll be arrested again for the Ramsey murder? Hardly. I do worry a bit about other cases in other parts of the country and the world but not about the dumbest criminal case in history. It takes competency on the part of law enforcement for me to be arrested again pertaining to the dumb ole Ramsey case.</p>

<p>I've only been concerned about the FBI making a move against me for all these years. The FBI and the DOJ are soon to be completely upended by the incoming president of America, Donald Trump. His critics say he's doing this to rid himself of his adversaries and protect himself from legal problems. If Trump aids in my own legal protection, I say, "Hail to the Chief!" My only true nemesis, since I was a teenager, has been the dreaded FBI. I say, bring them to their knees, President Trump. If you can do that for me, I salute you, Mr President!</p>

<p>Catch me if you can? You're all too goddamned stupid to even try. In October 2023, the father of JonBenet Ramsey released a formal statement saying that I stalked his family well before his daughter was murdered. You completely ignored that. You did nothing because you're idiots. Thanks to my beloved American president, Mr Donald Trump, the FBI and DOJ will fall by the wayside in a matter of months. I am thousands of miles outside the U.S. Just try to catch me, you fools. If you're even remotely thinking of approaching me, anywhere in the world, you'd better bring a goddamned army. Sieg! <a href="statements#catchmeifyoucan" target="_parent">Catch Me If You Can?</a> (November 28<sup>th</sup> 2024)</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><p><b>The Georgia Connection</b></p></div>
<p style="font-size:0.95rem;text-align:center;margin-top:-15px;">Statement of December 6<sup>th</sup> 2024</p>

<p>On October 4th 2023, News Nation's Ashleigh Banfield released a statement on her television broadcast from the father of JonBenet Ramsey. In it, John Ramsey stated he had "pretty strong evidence" that I had stalked his family well before his daughter was murdered.</p>

<p>Recently, I was told that Mr Ramsey revealed at least a portion of that "pretty strong evidence". It was an old news story released after my 2006 arrest. The Ramseys' housekeeper, at their Charlevoix Michigan vacation home, came forward and said she had caught someone rummaging through the Ramseys' vacation home garage, sometime prior to the death of JonBenet Ramsey, who fit the physical description of the man she was seeing all over the news. If anyone in law enforcement had been interested in the housekeeper's eyewitness account in 2006, they would've taken action and they certainly did not.</p>

<p>It must be asked, how would I know the Ramseys had a vacation home in Charlevoix? I was not a local. Looks like Charlevoix is an end without a beginning and a middle. Singling out Charlevoix with no logical order leading up to the stalking event is a mistake. It's missing the critical sequence of events that would lead up to me even knowing the vacation home in Charlevoix existed or that it belonged to the Ramseys who had a little girl I might be interested in stalking. This missing information would be devastating in a trial, if it ever comes to that. No one falls out of the clear blue sky and lands in the Ramseys' Charlevoix Michigan vacation home garage.</p>

<p>In and around 2006, whenever I was asked how I knew or met JonBenet Ramsey, by the authorities or the media, I declined to reveal my connection to her. Knowing her and accessing her would have required an adult liaison. Otherwise, knowing her would have required some situation that her and I were mutually involved in. As an example of a mutual situation, teachers know their students because of a situation that places them all in a classroom. In that case, no adult liaison is needed.</p>

<p>Then there is this accusation of stalking. In that scenario, no adult liaison nor a mutual situation would be required. However, such a strong accusation still requires evidence of how I knew my victim to begin with. I suppose Mr Ramsey feels that the connection to his daughter has been proven in Charlevoix Michigan by his housekeeper; however, it might be noted that Georgia was my state and his daughter's state and a place I frequented and lived in multiple times for all the years I have resided in the United States. Georgia could have led up to Charlevoix for me but not in reverse order.</p>

<p>If I knew JonBenet Ramsey, our initial connection would have taken place in Georgia where her and I were born and where we had both lived. I've lived in and frequented Atlanta for a lifetime. My father and brothers lived there. I had lived in Atlanta for years on end, alone in one of my dad's houses, during the time the Ramseys lived only a few miles from me. My twin daughters were to be born in January 1990 at Northside Hospital in Atlanta which was the same hospital JonBenet Ramsey was born in the same year. Even after the Ramseys moved away from Atlanta to Colorado, Patsy Ramsey frequently returned to Roswell Georgia with her children to visit her parents.</p>

<p>Am I discounting the housekeeper's eyewitness account that she saw me rummaging through the garage in Charlevoix? Not at all. Eyewitness accounts are powerful, but they can also be dismantled in a court of law by a good attorney, which I intend to have if this ever goes to trial. Since the authorities have seemingly never made the Georgia connection, why do I need to worry about the Charlevoix connection? If I knew JonBenet Ramsey, all roads would lead back to Georgia, whether various end destinations were Charlevoix or Boulder. JonBenet Ramsey was returned to Georgia, from whence she came, to rest eternally in its earth's warm embrace. <a href="statements#georgiaconnection" target="_parent">The Georgia Connection</a> (December 6<sup>th</sup> 2024)</p>

<figcaption><a href="jonbenetramsey"><b>JonBenet Ramsey</b></a> on Christmas morning 1996. (Photography Designed by John Mark Karr)</figcaption>
</figure>

<div style="text-align:center;"><p><b>Introduction to John Mark Karr</b></p></div>

<p>My name is John Mark Karr. I am the creator and author of this site as well as the designer of the photography here. A photo table of contents of this entire site follows this introduction. I have lived a very covert life outside the US since the summer of 2020. Since my first departure from America in 2001, my strategy for remaining private and safe has always consisted of constantly staying on the move and vowing never to return to America. I have paid dearly for parting from that plan in the past. The most recent span living in the US, from 2017 to 2020, is amongst my deepest regrets. I consider myself lucky to have survived it, in more ways than one.</p>

<p>In 2006, I was arrested in Bangkok Thailand for the murder, kidnapping, and sex assault of JonBenet Ramsey. It was not the first time I would come face to face with US federal law enforcement. In 2001, I was investigated by the FBI for six months while I languished in jail in Santa Rosa California. I was not released on my own recognizance until the national FBI investigation was completed. The 2001 FBI investigation ranged from child sex assault to national child serial murder. The FBI was involved in my 2006 investigation for the murder of JonBenet Ramsey along with the Department of Homeland Security. I have been the subject of multiple FBI investigations spanning over two decades or more.</p>

<p>This site is a small portion of my life story. It only covers the legal and media aspects of my life. I only touch on a few of the investigations that have been launched against me over the years by the FBI, Interpol, DHS and local authorities worldwide. I even touch on the complete blunders that some calling themselves "law enforcement" have made about me over the years - namely a fool puppet district attorney in Boulder Colorado in 2006. On the other hand, I've never considered the FBI, DHS, or Interpol to be incompetent as it relates to their international serial murder investigations or international abduction network investigations they've launched against me over the years. I acknowledge that these three agencies are among the most sophisticated and powerful law enforcement entities in the world.</p>

<p>Mostly, it's the powerful media that controls the narrative about me. This little website doesn't come close to their media monster websites and mighty TV networks. It's been said, those who control the narrative, control the world. I am far from controlling the narrative about John Mark Karr. The main reason is that I've been completely silenced by the media with the exception of the occasional phone call with reporters who promise the call is "off the record" but instead proceed to misquote me about everything I said and print it.</p>

<p>Blundering law enforcement, the media and their lies, and the public that has perpetuated the whole process, have seemingly granted me a lifetime of legal immunity. To all of you, I say the following: Thank you for setting me free. Thank you for making my life impossible in America, which led me to a safer and better life outside the US. Most of all, thank you for being the stupid idiots you have portrayed me as being for 18 years.</p>
	
<p>In the words of a surrendering Confederate officer to Union General Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain after the ceremony at Appomattox, I share his sentiments with my own enemies when he said, "You may forgive us but we won’t be forgiven. There is a rancor in our hearts which you little dream of. We hate you, sir."</p>

<div class="whatsoevercaption">In 2001, I was arrested in Petaluma California. For six months, I languished in semi-solitary confinement while the FBI investigated me for the serial murder of little girls across America. On a rainy November night in 2001, I boarded a plane in San Francisco bound for London. I would remain out of America for five years until my 2006 arrest. My family thought me to be dead.

<div class="whatsoevercaption">In 2019, a contact informed me that they were interviewed by the FBI for seven hours in 2006. They stated the interview was as much about Polly Klaas as JonBenet Ramsey. The FBI played numerous recorded calls from 2001 wherein I discussed Klaas in depth with an informant. The FBI stated that I had discussed details of Klaas with her killer in multiple conversations. I have a message for the FBI and Polly Klaas's killer in this October 2023 article.

<div class="whatsoevercaption">In 2007, I was investigated by the FBI for planning to organise a sex cult involving teenage girls. A computer containing the alleged plan was seized by the FBI. In 2010, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel interviewed with mainstream media for two months wherein she said I was the leader of a sex cult. Her account was filled with stories of the sexual abuse of little girls and a death squad that would kill on my command. <a href="karrcult" target="_parent">TAP TO VISIT THIS PAGE</a></div>

<div class="whatsoevercaption">Returning to 2006, after my release in Sonoma County California, I moved to Atlanta. In the months that followed in the same year, I was investigated by the Department of Homeland Security for international child sex trafficking, international child molestation and international murder of children. I was harassed by a neighborhood civic organization that sent out 2,000 letters to residents warning them of the threat - John Mark Karr. I was treated like a sex offender. I was harassed by hordes of law enforcement who would show up with lights flashing even for the mere sitting on a park bench overlooking a golf course in the middle of the day. My life was a living hell. I would not be able to remain in America for long. (Photo Designed by John Mark Karr) <a href="post2006" target="_parent">TAP TO VISIT THIS PAGE</a></div>
