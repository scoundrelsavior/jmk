<div class="headline"><p><b>Media Lies and Law Enforcement Blunders That Have Granted Me Immunity for Life</b></p></div>

<p class="Montserrat-ExtraLightItalic">My name is John Mark Karr. I am the creator and author of this site as well as the designer of the photography here. I have lived a very covert life outside the US since the summer of 2020. Since my first departure from America in 2001, my strategy for remaining private and safe has always consisted of constantly staying on the move and vowing never to return to America. I have paid dearly for parting from that plan in the past. The most recent span living in the US, from 2017 to 2020, is amongst my deepest regrets. I consider myself lucky to have survived it, in more ways than one.</p>

<p>This site is a small portion of my life story. It only covers the legal and media aspects of my life. I only touch on a few of the investigations that have been launched against me over the years by the FBI, Interpol, DHS and local authorities worldwide. I even touch on the complete blunders that some calling themselves "law enforcement" have made about me over the years - namely a fool puppet district attorney in Boulder Colorado in 2006. On the other hand, I've never considered the FBI, DHS, or Interpol to be incompetent as it relates to their international serial murder investigations or international abduction network investigations they've launched against me over the years. I acknowledge that these three agencies are among the most sophisticated and powerful law enforcement entities in the world.</p>

<p>Mostly, it's the powerful media that controls the narrative about me. This little website doesn't come close to their media monster websites and mighty TV networks. It's been said, those who control the narrative, control the world. I am far from controlling the narrative about John Mark Karr. The main reason is that I've been completely silenced by the media with the exception of the occasional phone call with reporters who promise the call is "off the record" but instead proceed to misquote me about everything I said and print it, or the outright lies that I've done interviews that I haven't done. Sure, the media might let me say a sentence or two but be certain, they will sabotage statements or comments I might say to suit their own anti-Karr agenda. For future references, due to a very bad experience I had in September 2023 - if you're the media and you promise the bullshit "off the record" call in an attempt to hijack what you will then publish as "an interview", you can go to hell.</p>

<p>Aside from the time I was set free by the blundering idiots of law enforcement in Boulder Colorado in 2006, the media and their adoring public have set me free for almost two decades with their stupid lies that make me look like an absolute idiot. In a sense, the media, and the public who perpetuates their lying narrative, have granted me permanent immunity against any and all murder charges and subsequent convictions that might come my way, for the rest of my life. If the media says I was a delusional, lying sack of shit in 2006, about a high class little girl they think I was too pathetic to even meet, the public latches on to that lie and now promotes it on social media, adding their own lies in their posts about me on platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and X.</p>

<p>Blundering law enforcement, the media and their lies, and the public that has perpetuated the whole process, are the real idiotic fools. Why? Because these damned idiots have granted me a lifetime of legal immunity. To all of you, I say the following: Thank you for setting me free. Thank you for making my life impossible in America, which led me to a safer and better life outside the US. Most of all, thank you for being the stupid idiots you have portrayed me as being for 17 years.</p>
	
<p>In the words of a surrendering Confederate officer to Union General Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain after the ceremony at Appomattox, I share his sentiments with my own enemies when he said, "You may forgive us but we won’t be forgiven. There is a rancor in our hearts which you little dream of. We hate you, sir."</p>

<div class="whatsoevercaption">Being arrested in 2006 was what I had successfully avoided for 10 years since her death and for the 5 years of international running as a fugitive leading up to my 2006 arrest. The proof of that was the fact that I was in my 5th year of evading California authorities and the FBI when I was arrested against my will in 2006. I did not want fame for killing a child. The media arrived from all over the world and descended in on me against my will. Am I to be blamed for this?

<div class="whatsoevercaption">In 2019, a contact informed me that they were interviewed by the FBI for seven hours in 2006. They stated the interview was as much about Polly Klaas as JonBenet Ramsey. The FBI played numerous recorded calls from 2001 wherein I discussed Klaas in depth with an informant. The FBI stated that I had discussed details of Klaas with her killer in multiple conversations. I have a message for the FBI and Polly Klaas's killer in this October 2023 article.

A computer containing the alleged plan was seized by the FBI. In 2010, nineteen year old Samantha Spiegel interviewed with mainstream media for two months wherein she said I was the leader of a sex cult. Her account was filled with stories of the sexual abuse of little girls and a death squad that would kill on my command.

<p style="text-align:center"><b>PUBLIC STATEMENTS</b></p>

<p>What follows are statements I have released since 2016. When I have anything I consider important to say, I release a statement here. When and if I find out there are lies circulating about me in the media or I have something to say in response to other issues in the media related to me, I release those statements here. On rare occasions, I update statements which is indicated and dated.</p>

<p id="johnramseyallegation" style="text-align:center"><b>Damning Allegation Made Against Me That I Was Unaware of Until Five Months Later</b></p>

<p>Only recently did I discover that, on October 4th 2023, News Nation's Ashleigh Banfield released a statement on her television broadcast from the father of JonBenet Ramsey. In it, John Ramsey stated he had "pretty strong evidence" that could prove his allegation against me. If that is true, it would be one of the most damning allegations ever brought against me.</p>

<p>Why did I not find out what Ramsey said about me until recently? Contrary to the public's insistence that I am an attention seeking whore who runs around consuming every shred of news about myself, that is simply not true and never has been. I do not read or view any news or social media about myself. I do not Google my name. I do not Google the Colorado girl's name. With that said, I didn't see the News Nation telecast of October 4th, 2023. It took 5 months for just a fraction of the media coverage in October 2023 to trickle down to me through emails and text messages from people in the public who were letting me know what was being said about me.</p>

<p>The most legally damaging statement made about me during the October 2023 media coverage was the final sentence of the statement from John Ramsey released on News Nation. Ramsey said of me, "There is pretty strong evidence that he was stalking our family for a good while prior to JonBenet's murder.”</p>

<p>If John Ramsey can prove that his above accusation is true, it would establish knowledge of the victim well before the fact. It would also establish proximity to the victim well before the fact. Because John Ramsey is the father of the victim, his words are taken more seriously than most. This information, now public, has certainly compromised any possible ongoing investigations against me.</p>

<p>Regardless of such a serious allegation against me concerning the death of his daughter, I still stand behind what I said of him, his wife, and his son in my October 5th, 2023 public statement. However, I must confirm that I was not aware of Ramsey's strong allegation against me just one day before I released my October 5th 2023 statement wherein I devoted a paragraph to him and his family.</p>

<p>Finally, had I known Mr Ramsey made such an allegation against me five months ago, I certainly would have promptly responded exactly as I have today. I will continue my stance to never read any news articles, watch any news videos, or delve into anything said about me on social media or online forums. I do admit, however, that it cripples me in knowing what is said against me so that I might defend myself. But do I really have a defense against damning allegations against me? I think not. This tiny site is seen by a handful of people. The News Nation telecast, along with other international publications that carried this story, were seen by millions. The few people who do visit this site have no regard for anything I might say in my own defense. (March 5th 2024) Read my October 5th, 2023 statement below.</p>

<p id="protectingkiller" style="text-align:center"><b>I Know Who JonBenet Ramsey's Killer Was and I'm Protecting Them? Think Again!</b></p>

<p>A reporter from <a href="https://the-sun.com" >The U.S. Sun</a> alerted me via e-mail that there was a reporter who had done an interview with News Nation on October 4th, 2023. In it, the reporter stated that I had told him that I knew who killed JonBenet Ramsey and I was protecting them. I have never said anything like that. If you see me on camera, live, making a complete statement, that's not a soundbite, or taken out of context - you can take that seriously. Otherwise, always doubt anything you read or see about me. It is the media's backstabbing technique reserved especially for me as a pure act of sabotage. Do you want truth or some news media hyped concoction?</p>

<p>And who is this person who killed JonBenet Ramsey that all of you in the public and the media insist that I know and now protect? Her brother? Her father? Her loving mother? I know you would love to see but one of them burn for this child's death. I know it because you have expressed it for decades. I have never suggested that anyone in this family was the killer of this little girl. Has this discussion ever come up with those I have spoken to over the years? Of course. The reason being, these three people have been targets for all these years as suspects in their own family member's death. This is not "the moment you've all been waiting for" when I raise my finger of blame and condemnation and point it at any of the members of JonBenet's family.</p>

<p>In 2006, I took full responsibility for the death of JonBenet Ramsey. In an intense phone call with a professor in Boulder Colorado, I described how I killed JonBenet Ramsey, by my own hand. These descriptions corroborated with physical evidence that was withheld from the public by the coroner and law enforcement for ten years. According to the authorities who arrested me, as well as the FBI - it was information only the killer would know. This is why I, and no one else, was arrested for the murder, kidnapping, and sex assault of JonBenet Ramsey. (October 05, 2023 - Updated 12/04/23 to add that an e-mail from a reporter with The U.S. Sun was the source for my reaction. Updated 03/05/24 to clarify a previous misconception of the information that was presented to me.) <a href="#top">Tap to Return to Top</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday 21 February, a contact sent a text message to me containing this news story from KFM 94.5's website entitled, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231009125436/https://kfm.co.za/articles/2023/02/21/is-she-madeleine-mccann-polish-woman-may-be-missing-toddler-from-15-years-ago" target="_blank">"Is She Madeleine McCann? Polish Woman May Be Missing Toddler From 15 Years Ago."</a> In it, a 21 year old woman named Julia Wendelet is showcased using information from her Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iammadeleinemccan/" target="_blank">@iammadeleinemccan</a> (note how she misspells 'mccann'). You can be rest assured that Julia Wendelet is not the former Madeleine McCann. Madeleine has never been aware of her connection to the media coverage of the Madeleine McCann case. Has she ever seen it in her lifetime? Possibly, but she has never made any personal connection to the news stories over the years. Those involved in taking her were highly skilled, experienced, and well connected. With that said, consider that Madeleine was very well placed. And if she was very well placed, she was then and will be safe, well cared for, and loved.

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Death Threat E-mail</strong></p>

<p>On January 31st GMT, I received a death threat via e-mail from societysucks88@icloud.com with the subject field: "I want to cut your head off and stuff it up your p**ssy". The e-mail was submitted to the FBI. According to digital forensics, this death threat e-mail was sent from the vicinity of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. The full name of the sender was included in the e-mail sender field and is listed in my Tweet below. A couple of days after my report, the FBI called my US phone number and left a message stating that they were interested in further details. I returned the FBI's call on the following day. I got an e-mail contact from the agent during the call that enabled me to send further information that might lead to the sender of the e-mail. I take death threats seriously. I will report all threats to the FBI, your local authorities, or both. Full email <a href="images/deaththreat-jan31-2023.png" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>My Exit From America in 2020</strong></p>
	
<p>In early summer 2020, I sold my house in America and left the United States. It was never any secret that my house was on the market for sale last year. At one point, it was listed on the MLS. I owned the house for only two years and ten months. In 2017, after living for only weeks in the house, I was exposed to the media by people I had allowed in my home as guests. I was portrayed by the media and treated by the public as a dangerous threat to society though I had never been convicted of a crime. After the 2017 media exposure, some asked me why I returned to America in the first place. I returned to the US in 2017 because I had every right to do so. I returned to the US in 2017 and bought a house there because I had every right to live in my own home, in my own country, as a citizen of the United States with full blown constitutional rights that is afforded to every natural born citizen who has never been convicted of a crime. I had those rights but, while there, that did not prevent some Americans from violating them wholesale - walking by my house shouting "Murderer!", "Killer!", "Serial Killer" and "Child Rapist" mostly occurring in broad daylight as I worked to restore my historical home which remains an asset to the community long after I am gone. I also had the right to sell my house and leave the United States in peace and in privacy without the media exploiting the event and without the accusation that I was running from something. I guarded the sale of my home when it occurred last year not because I was sneaking around like some lowly criminal but because of my concerns that the media would exploit the sale of the house as they had exploited the purchase of it which would have compromised not only my privacy but the privacy of the new owner of the home. After discovering recently that certain persons planned on profiting from and exploiting the release of this information, I reluctantly decided to post this statement on my website almost seven months after the fact. I was never then nor am I now in any way obligated to inform you: my haters, my enemies, and to whom it may concern - but here it is nonetheless. (January 13th 2021)</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>My Brush With Kamala Harris</b></p>
	
<p>In 2010, I was accused of everything from felony death threats to being a sex cult leader. Fox News reported that there was a warrant out for my arrest and that the police in San Francisco were looking for me. The media directed their attention to the San Francisco District Attorney's Office that released this statement in response: "At this point, there is no case to review for charging," says spokeswoman Erica Derryck." (Seattle Weekly). The San Francisco district attorney at that time was U.S. Vice President elect Kamala Harris who was not swayed by media pressure, false accusations, or public opinion and expeditiously closed down the rumor that her office had criminally charged me.

<p>I have been approached for answers about the latest development in the case surrounding Madeleine McCann. The authorities are determined that any pedophile they can prove mere proximity to Madeleine is a prime suspect in this case and worse - a killer of a little girl. This time around, it is imprisoned pedophile, Christian Brückner. He has vowed that he will admit to nothing until authorities can provide proof that he is somehow connected to Madeleine McCann. In other words, he's said a sound "f**k you" to the law who wants to peg him. The truth is, they will not be able to show such proof. He's never met Madeleine because her disappearance had nothing to do with a pedophile imprisoned in Germany or anywhere else in the world. He would, however, make a wonderful fall guy who authorities would not hesitate to elect. Do you want the truth or a poor excuse for it provided to you by out of touch authorities trying to make a name for themselves? Madeleine McCann is alive and well and unaware of the swirl that surrounds her.

<p style="text-align:center"><b>The 2016 DNA Probe</b></p>

<p>Boulder Police is asking the state to conduct a new round of DNA testing. It's pretty obvious why they should make such a request now. Last month, DNA experts uncovered that the DNA that let me walk in 2006 was a composite of several DNA samples in one. It was also uncovered that Lacy was fully aware that the tiny sample was a composite before she used it to "exonerate" the Ramsey's. The "little DNA that could" is slowly capitulating. A call to the state for a nice replacement has become a necessity for those who insist that this is a DNA case while experts for years have said it is not.</p>
	
<p>Lacy publicly humiliated me in front of the whole world with her accusation that I was a delusional liar because my DNA didn't match that random, drive-by DNA that established nothing and could never be used to pinpoint any one person, much less a killer. I must admit, I'm sad to see that little DNA sample go. It's been good to me over the years.</p>
	
<p>I've been asked if I'm worried about this latest DNA development. Of course, I've always had great concerns that my DNA was left behind; however, with the small time local authorities who are in charge of this case along with the corruption that has been proven over the years, I'm not as worried as I would be if it were a valid agency with proper resources, not influenced by wealth or fame or political gain. The day this case falls into the hands of the FBI will be the day I'll have something to worry about. (UPDATE: It was confirmed to me in 2018 by a close contact interviewed by the FBI in 2006, along with a media interview with the FBI in September 2023, that the FBI has investigated me for the murder of JonBenet Ramsey all this time.)

<p style="text-align:center"><b>Discovery ID Ramsey Television Special</b></p>

<p>The American public deserves to know that I gave six hours of quality interview time to Discovery in Bangkok on JonBenet's birthday. I revealed new information about JonBenet's death. You will never hear that. I dismantled the DNA. You will never hear that. I talked about how my DNA was taken in 2006 which was a total joke. You will never hear that. I responded to the ridiculous way Mary Lacy mishandled my arrest in 2006. My right to defend myself and tell my side of the story was dumped. Most importantly, I talked about a law that would save children's lives. This was also axed. I feel the American people have the right to know that they were robbed of all this and more by Discovery's decision to merely roll old 2006 footage and call me a lunatic liar. Six hours were reduced to a few sentences spread across three nights. Investigation Discovery used my image and name to promote their show for three nights making promises that, on the third night, there would be an exclusive interview with me. That never happened. Instead, Americans got the dog and pony show. I am receiving hundreds of visits from Americans looking for an answer. You didn't get those answers in the ID exploitation and public humiliation of John Mark Karr. (September 16th 2016)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Surviving Life in America from 2006 to 2008</b></p>

<p>Returning to 2006, after my release in Sonoma County California, I moved to Atlanta. In the months that followed in the same year, I was investigated by the Department of Homeland Security for international child sex trafficking, international child molestation and international murder of children. I was harassed by a neighborhood civic organization that sent out 2,000 letters to residents warning them of the threat - John Mark Karr. I was treated like a sex offender. I was harassed by hordes of law enforcement who would show up with lights flashing even for the mere sitting on a park bench overlooking a golf course in the middle of the day. My life was a living hell. I would not be able to remain in America for long.</p>

<img src="images/jmkcourtatl.jpg" alt="JMK Brooke Court" id="jmkbrookecourt"/>
 
<p>In 2007, I was arrested for the battery of my elderly father, Wex Karr. In reality, Wex Karr was holding me against my bedroom wall by the throat. I struggled to release his two very strong hands from my throat which might have possibly left marks on his arm. Brooke Dovgan was a witness to all this and reported it to the police that night.</p>
 
<p>Earlier that week, my father came into the house with a black eye and told Brooke Dovgan and me that he’d run into a tree limb. I’m sure police blamed his black eye on me as well.</p>
 
<p>Charges included the prevention of a 911 call. In reality, I merely requested that my father not call the police in reaction to an argument I was in at the time with my then girlfriend, Brooke Dovgan. I did not threaten him in any way. I pleaded with him not to create something major over something trivial. Wex Karr became very angry and threw his own phone down a hallway, hitting the walls and breaking his phone. When police arrived, I was blamed for the broken phone.</p>
 
<p>In the end, I was ordered to attend anger management classes by a judge after pleading no contest to the charges which, again, was a huge blunder on my part and based on flimsy advice from an attorney. I covered for Wex Karr for the mere fact that I had no place to go and nowhere to live. I look back on it now and wish I’d checked into a homeless shelter and let the world know what really happened to me. All charges were dropped against Wex Karr. Go figure. The charges against me were expunged, for the little that is worth.</p>
 
<img class="cho" src="images/cho3.jpg" alt="Cho"/>
 
<p>It was in that same year that Seung Cho murdered 33 students at Virginia Tech. In his final manifesto, thought to be written during the killings, Cho mentioned me on page 16 stating, "You wanna rape us, John Mark Karrs? Fuck you!" My heart was broken when I heard about this. My fears were confirmed that mass murderers like Cho had me on their minds. I was reminded how very dangerous it was for me to remain in the U.S. </p>
 
<p>Some have even scoffed at my fearful reaction to Cho's statement in his final manifesto saying, "But Cho is dead now and can't hurt you." A grim reminder of Cho's manifesto resurfaced on August 26, 2015 when WDBJ-TV reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward were shot to death during a live interview in Moneta, Virginia by a past fellow journalist, Vester Lee Flanagan aka Bryce Williams. Flanagan also wrote a final manifesto and in it he said: "Also, I was influenced by Seung-Hui Cho. That's my boy right there. He got NEARLY double the amount that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold got…just sayin'."</p>

<p>My desire to once again have some semblance of privacy and protection reached a point of desperation in 2008 when the name John Mark Karr was legally changed to Alexis Valoran Reich. The attempt was futile. In 2010, the name was sold to the tabloids in an exclusive interview in the National Enquirer with Brooke Dovgan. The person accused of wanting attention was exposed against his will once more. The name was turned into a dot com and served as a tracking device. The John Mark Karr entry at Wikipedia was vacated and changed to Alexis Valoran Reich for the same purposes. Wikipedia has since removed all main entries for either name.</p>

<p>With all that said, I have not been living as a woman named Alexis Valoran Reich for all these years. There was nothing in the aforementioned paragraph that made any such suggestion. This is something that has been published for many years since the 2010 tabloid exposure as a form of malicious mockery. It is not reported by journalists in their articles to show me any respect - quite the contrary. It was a character assassination from the get go in 2010 when it was sold to the tabloids. It's just part of the slaughter campaign. Now that there is so much vitriol for transgender people, it's being touted again. They know it will result in more hatred against me. Transgender people get beaten and sometimes killed. Nothing would make my haters in the public and the media happier. I am not Alexis Valoran Reich, the woman. I am John Mark Karr, the man. Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that but this is what I'm willing to share now.</p>

<p>Most of the events of 2010 revolved around the actions of a vigilante hate group that attempted to derail my life based on their lowly opinion of me and not on any evidence that I was a monster let loose on the world's children. They bought and set up websites using the names John Mark Karr and Alexis Valoran Reich that distributed Karr hate propaganda designed to trace and track me - to rank high in the Google searches for both names to tip off anyone that I was a monster who should be turned over to authorities. These crusaders to protect children from horrible monster John Mark Karr were based in America and consisted of friends, past girlfriends, and even family members.

<div class="whatsoevercaption">Eight year old Marnie Green of Burnley England is beside herself at the outrageous price of two ice creams. “So there’s an ice cream van selling two ice creams, with two chewing gums in it, for bloody £9.... nine quid! That is gonna get nowhere with that! He should know! And he only does bloody card - stood there with my cash! Bloody hell! Bloody well bad!” In the end, Marnie sarcastically shouted, "Yeah! Bet he can hear me!" before she scampered away with twin sister, Mylah, reminding us that we've just been listening to an eight year old instead of a twenty-five year old. Marnie's Aunt Karis got it all on video <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@karislambert/video/7368552019465915681" target="_blank">here</a>.
