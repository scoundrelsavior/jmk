If you do decide to pursue me, you won't find me because you're too dumb to know how. I'll turn 61 in freedom in some beautiful foreign land and there won't be a goddamned thing that any of you can do about it. Take the justice that you so fervently seek and shove it up your ass.

<div style="text-align:center;"><p><b>Catch Me If You Can?</p></b></div>
<p style="font-size:0.95rem;text-align:center;margin-top:-15px;">Statement of November 28<sup>th</sup> 2024</p>

<p>A possible present day arrest of JMK would look very different from the 2006 arrest in Bangkok. There would be no more admissions of guilt or talk of loving a little girl and wanting closure for her family by a 'soft spoken school teacher' while he cries in a phone call that's being recorded by U.S. federal agents. The present day version of John Mark Karr is bitter, angry and ready to fight. Today's JMK feels no guilt or compassion or love for any victims or their families. You are all my enemies and I am prepared to conquer you in a bloody battle.</p>

<p>Am I worried I'll be arrested again for the Ramsey murder? Hardly. I do worry a bit about other cases in other parts of the country and the world but not about the dumbest criminal case in history. It takes competency on the part of law enforcement for me to be arrested again pertaining to the dumb ole Ramsey case.</p>

<p>I've only been concerned about the FBI making a move against me for all these years. The FBI and the DOJ are soon to be completely upended by the incoming president of America, Donald Trump. His critics say he's doing this to rid himself of his adversaries and protect himself from legal problems. If Trump aids in my own legal protection, I say, "Hail to the Chief!" My only true nemesis, since I was a teenager, has been the dreaded FBI. I say, bring them to their knees, President Trump. If you can do that for me, I salute you, Mr President!</p>

<p>Catch me if you can? You're all too goddamned stupid to even try. In October 2023, the father of JonBenet Ramsey released a formal statement saying that I stalked his family well before his daughter was murdered. You completely ignored that. You did nothing because you're idiots. Thanks to my beloved American president, Mr Donald Trump, the FBI and DOJ will fall by the wayside in a matter of months. I am thousands of miles outside the U.S. Just try to catch me, you fools. If you're even remotely thinking of approaching me, anywhere in the world, you'd better bring a goddamned army. Sieg!

<p>Recently, I was told that Mr Ramsey revealed at least a portion of that "pretty strong evidence". It was an old news story released after my 2006 arrest. The Ramseys' housekeeper, at their Charlevoix Michigan vacation home, came forward and said she had caught someone rummaging through the Ramseys' vacation home garage, sometime prior to the death of JonBenet Ramsey, who fit the physical description of the man she was seeing all over the news. If anyone in law enforcement had been interested in the housekeeper's eyewitness account in 2006, they would've taken action and they certainly did not.</p>

<p>It must be asked, how would I know the Ramseys had a vacation home in Charlevoix? I was not a local. Looks like Charlevoix is an end without a beginning and a middle. Singling out Charlevoix with no logical order leading up to the stalking event is a mistake. It's missing the critical sequence of events that would lead up to me even knowing the vacation home in Charlevoix existed or that it belonged to the Ramseys who had a little girl I might be interested in stalking. This missing information would be devastating in a trial, if it ever comes to that. No one falls out of the clear blue sky and lands in the Ramseys' Charlevoix Michigan vacation home garage.</p>

<p>In and around 2006, whenever I was asked how I knew or met JonBenet Ramsey, by the authorities or the media, I declined to reveal my connection to her. Knowing her and accessing her would have required an adult liaison. Otherwise, knowing her would have required some situation that her and I were mutually involved in. As an example of a mutual situation, teachers know their students because of a situation that places them all in a classroom. In that case, no adult liaison is needed.</p>

<p>Then there is this accusation of stalking. In that scenario, no adult liaison nor a mutual situation would be required. However, such a strong accusation still requires evidence of how I knew my victim to begin with. I suppose Mr Ramsey feels that the connection to his daughter has been proven in Charlevoix Michigan by his housekeeper; however, it might be noted that Georgia was my state and his daughter's state and a place I frequented and lived in multiple times for all the years I have resided in the United States. Georgia could have led up to Charlevoix for me but not in reverse order.</p>

<p>If I knew JonBenet Ramsey, our initial connection would have taken place in Georgia where her and I were born and where we had both lived. I've lived in and frequented Atlanta for a lifetime. My father and brothers lived there. I had lived in Atlanta for years on end, alone in one of my dad's houses, during the time the Ramseys lived only a few miles from me. My twin daughters were to be born in January 1990 at Northside Hospital in Atlanta which was the same hospital JonBenet Ramsey was born in the same year. Even after the Ramseys moved away from Atlanta to Colorado, Patsy Ramsey frequently returned to Roswell Georgia with her children to visit her parents.</p>

<p>Am I discounting the housekeeper's eyewitness account that she saw me rummaging through the garage in Charlevoix? Not at all. Eyewitness accounts are powerful, but they can also be dismantled in a court of law by a good attorney, which I intend to have if this ever goes to trial. Since the authorities have seemingly never made the Georgia connection, why do I need to worry about the Charlevoix connection? If I knew JonBenet Ramsey, all roads would lead back to Georgia, whether various end destinations were Charlevoix or Boulder. JonBenet Ramsey was returned to Georgia, from whence she came, to rest eternally in its earth's warm embrace.

<div class="headline"><p><b>Where Justice Lies</b></p></div>
<p style="font-size:0.95rem;text-align:center;margin-top:-15px;">E-mail Sent December 9<sup>th</sup> 2024</p>

<p><span class="Montserrat-ExtraLightItalic" style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The Sender Wrote</b></span> - John, my husband and I watched the Netflix documentary yesterday. There was a lot about you in Part 3.</p>

<p>John, myself and so many others who have been on this case for years, KNOW you killed JonBenet. I believe it wasn’t your intention. You allowed yourself to get into the “trance” as you stated. It went too far and you decided to use the flashlight to kill her.</p>

<p>It is so obvious you wrote the note, John. It’s exactly how you talk, at least back then. YOU DODGED a bullet with the DNA bullshit. You were careful, but there were items that weren’t tested. You will be caught eventually. I am hearing a lot is going on with the testing that you aren’t aware of, and that’s not being reported. You think you can’t be tracked. It will be quite easy to find you.</p>

<p>Michael Tracey still believes you are guilty. And I know John Ramsay believes it too, but legally, he can’t say much. Here is my plea to you:</p>

<p>YOU HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY SELFISH for 28 years. Besides the murder itself, you have chosen to run, to hide, to deceive, to manipulate. The PAIN you caused Patsy (you are partly responsible for her death as well John). Cancer spreads and metastasizes more when the patient is under severe stress or in deep depression.</p>

<p>You are a COWARD John. You can spin it any way you want. You are an evil coward. You should have been in prison for the last 28 years. You have also cost tens of millions of dollars to law enforcement that could have been used elsewhere. You caused grief to Lou Smit and his family. You have greatly damaged John, Burke, John’s two other kids and so many more.</p>

<p>You are going to turn 60 on Wed. You are 3/4, or much more, through your life. You will meet your Maker soon enough. And unless you renounce this evil you perpetrated (and it doesn’t matter yhat is was because of an “addiction” you were in), you are going to hell for eternity. God will not forgive you if you don’t set things right down here. That’s not how it works. You could scream out “JonBenet, please forgive me”, it doesn’t matter. You could ask God to forgive you. It doesn’t matter. You could get a sex change surgery. It doesn’t matter. YOU, JOHN MARK KARR, KILLED A YOUNG, PRECIOUS CHILD. And you have destroyed so many people’s lives. Your evil heart, your immoral character, your manipulation, your selfishness, your arrogance, your greed, your mental illness are what you will answer for. You will have no excuse John. That’s all you have done since 2006. And even before, you make it about you and you make it about your suffering.</p>

<p>If you want true, meaningful, eternal forgiveness, your only chance is to turn yourself in. Period. End of discussion. You are on your way to torment in the Afterlife. And your remaining years are guaranteed to be torturous. Why? Because there is a group of over 35,000 people out there who pray for your misery and torment until you confess.</p>

<p>You will actually leave a respectable legacy to many people if you turn yourself in. And God will forgive you. That’s your only chance. If you take your life, that will result in your eternal torment as well. There is only one path. Like you told the truth back in 2006, with great detail, like you showed some legitimate remorse and contrition, you have to come forward after 18 1/2 additional agonizing years you have put so many through.</p>

<p>Follow my instructions and you stand a 100% of actually being forgiven (which you have never been). It is up to you now John.-Saved By The Cross</p>

<p>P.S. YOUR suffering is 1% or less than what you caused JonBenet, Patsy, Burke and John Sr. And there are hundreds more.</p>

<p><span class="Montserrat-ExtraLightItalic" style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>John Mark Karr Replied</b></span> - I read your letter carefully. I respect the pouring out of your stance against me. I completely understand how you feel, in light of my past. You have every right to say most of the things that you said to me. Your anger towards me is merited. I accept your anger completely and know I am deserving of it.</p>

<p>Yes, I am outside of America in an undisclosed location for my own safety. It is a survival instinct which is very natural. While you might think that I don't deserve to be living comfortably in Europe or Asia or Australia, it was your very own U.S. authorities who set me free in 2006 to arrive here. I didn't make a Bundy break out of jail and leave the country like some coward escaping justice. The door to my cell was opened for me by your American authorities. Ultimately, I left jail on a red carpet.</p>

<p>I should turn myself in? I have never surrendered to any authority in my life. The only reason the authorities touched me in 2006 was because Tracey broke his promise to me that our conversations were private and turned me over to law enforcement. I was CAUGHT in 2006 and I will do everything possible to make sure that never happens again. That's not cowardice, madam - it's power.</p>

<p>You are right to care about this little girl and want justice for her. She deserved much better and continues to deserve much better in death. I agree that she deserves justice; however, justice does not lie in my hands. Justice lies in the hands of the authorities.

<div class="whatsoevercaption">In 2006, I was arrested for the murder, kidnapping, and sex assault of six year old JonBenet Ramsey and extradited from Bangkok to Boulder Colorado. My arrest was based on my account of the night of her death that corroborated with physical evidence withheld from the public by the coroner and law enforcement from 1996 to 2006.

For six months, I languished in semi-solitary confinement while the FBI investigated me for the serial murder of little girls across America. On a rainy November night in 2001, I boarded a plane in San Francisco bound for London. I would remain out of America for five years until my 2006 arrest. My family thought me to be dead.

<div class="whatsoevercaption">In 2019, a contact informed me that they were interviewed by the FBI for seven hours in 2006. They stated the interview was as much about Polly Klaas as JonBenet Ramsey. The FBI played numerous recorded calls from 2001 wherein I discussed Klaas in depth with an informant. The FBI stated that I had discussed details of Klaas with her killer in multiple conversations. I have a message for the FBI and Polly Klaas's killer in this October 2023 article.

Her account was filled with stories of the sexual abuse of little girls and a death squad that would kill on my command. <a href="karrcult" target="_parent">TAP TO VISIT THIS PAGE</a></div>

<div class="whatsoevercaption">Returning to 2006, after my release in Sonoma County California, I moved to Atlanta. In the months that followed in the same year, I was investigated by the Department of Homeland Security for international child sex trafficking, international child molestation and international murder of children. I was harassed by a neighborhood civic organization that sent out 2,000 letters to residents warning them of the threat - John Mark Karr. I was treated like a sex offender. I was harassed by hordes of law enforcement who would show up with lights flashing even for the mere sitting on a park bench overlooking a golf course in the middle of the day. My life was a living hell. I would not be able to remain in America for long. (Photo Designed by John Mark Karr) <a href="post2006" target="_parent">TAP TO VISIT THIS PAGE</a></div>
